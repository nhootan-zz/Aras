Build Instructions
==================

Aras is built on top of Fast Downward code base: http://www.fast-downward.org. 
Hence, the building process is the same:

1- cd Aras
2- cd src
3- ./build_all

Parts of FD are implemented in C++, and parts are implemented
in Python. You will need a Python interpreter, version 2.7  to
run it.

Running the Planner
===================
1- cd Aras
2- cd src
3- ./plan domainfile problemfile aras_config

Typical Aras configuration:
--postprocessor "aras()" --input-plan-file input_file --plan-file output_file

Example: ./plan Elevators/domain.pddl Elevators/p07.pddl --postprocessor "aras()" --input-plan-file aras_input --plan-file aras_output

To get a description of the available parameters for Aras use 
src/downward-1 --help aras

Unless it is necessary, please control the memory and time limits (ulimit) from outside the program:
the memory_limit implemented in aras does not work accurately. 

For domains with conditional effects please set the parameter reg_graph to false.
Example: ./plan Elevators/domain.pddl Elevators/p07.pddl --postprocessor "aras(reg_graph=false)" --input-plan-file aras_input --plan-file aras_output
